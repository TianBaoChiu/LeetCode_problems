# Problem Description
# 20. Valid Parentheses

# Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

# An input string is valid if:

# Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
# Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
# Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "()"
# Output: true
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "()[]{}"
# Output: true
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "(]"
# Output: false

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 104
# s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.
